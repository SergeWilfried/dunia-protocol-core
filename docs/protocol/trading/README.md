description: Buying and selling COWRIE

# Trading

This section applies to buying and selling COWRIE from the protocol or on incentivized COWRIE Uniswap pools. Users can always buy and sell on secondary markets where they exist.

## Buying COWRIE

Users can acquire COWRIE in the following \(non-exhaustive\) ways:

* Using the [CowrieRouter](feirouter.md), exposed on [app.cowrie.money](https://app.cowrie.money)
* Buying from the [bonding curve](../bondingcurve/ethbondingcurve.md)
* Buying directly on the ETH/COWRIE Uniswap pool

The bonding curve is currently not exposed via [app.cowrie.money](https://app.cowrie.money). The Cowrie Core Team is considering a feature to optimize the trading price of Cowrie Protocol UI by going to the bonding curve if offers a better deal. 

## Selling COWRIE

The router is exposed on [app.cowrie.money](https://app.cowrie.money), with parameters to protect against slippage and bound penalties.
